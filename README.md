# DevOps Learning Portfolio

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey in DevOps, focusing on core infrastructure, networking, cloud services, Linux, and automation.

The goal of this repo is to demonstrate practical understanding rather than theory alone. Each module contains real implementations, screenshots, commands used, and reflections on what I learned along the way.

## Modules

### Linux Fundamentals
- Solutions to Bandit games. (Soon)

### Scripting with Bash
- Useful Bash scripts. (Soon)

### Git Course
-

### Networking
- Deployed a Linux server on AWS EC2
- Installed and ran NGINX
- Configured DNS using Cloudflare
- Connected a custom domain to the EC2 instance
- Verified traffic flow from browser to server

More modules will be added as I progress through areas such as:
- Terraform
- CI/CD pipelines
- Kubernetes


## Why this repo exists
Rather than keeping notes in isolation, this repository acts as a growing DevOps portfolio that shows:
- how I approach infrastructure problems
- how I document technical work
- how I apply concepts in real environments

## Tech used so far
- AWS EC2
- Ubuntu Linux
- NGINX
- Cloudflare DNS
- Git & GitHub
- SSH

Each module contains its own README with detailed explanations and evidence.
