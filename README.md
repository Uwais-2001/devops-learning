# DevOps Learning Portfolio

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey in DevOps, focusing on core infrastructure, networking, cloud services, Linux, containers, and automation.

The goal of this repo is to demonstrate practical understanding rather than theory alone. Each module contains real implementations, configuration files, commands used, and reflections on what I learned along the way.

## Modules

### Linux Fundamentals

- Solutions to Bandit games (in progress)

### Scripting with Bash

- Useful Bash scripts (in progress)

### Git Course

- Version control fundamentals and workflow practice

### Networking

- Deployed a Linux server on AWS EC2
- Installed and ran NGINX
- Configured DNS using Cloudflare
- Connected a custom domain to the EC2 instance
- Verified traffic flow from browser to server

### Docker & Containers

- Built a containerised Flask application
- Integrated Redis as a separate service
- Created a custom Docker image using a Dockerfile
- Orchestrated multiple containers using Docker Compose
- Implemented service-to-service communication via Docker networking
- Added persistent storage using Docker named volumes

More modules will be added as I progress through areas such as:

- Terraform
- CI/CD pipelines
- Kubernetes

## Why this repo exists

Rather than keeping notes in isolation, this repository acts as a growing DevOps portfolio that shows:

- how I approach infrastructure and deployment problems
- how I document technical work
- how I apply concepts in real environments

## Tech used so far

- AWS EC2
- Ubuntu Linux
- NGINX
- Cloudflare DNS
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Redis
- Git & GitHub
- SSH

Each module contains its own README with detailed explanations and evidence.
